 <summary><h3>👨‍💻 Deepanker's Coding Journey</h3></summary>
 My coding journey started at quite an early age, I first started my coding journey during 2018, where I built the Follow Bot as a part of a summer course  that I signed up to during high school. The purpose of the project was to create a robot that follows the owner and carries a payload for the owner. I ended up coding the project. After building my first project, I was captivated by the ability to solve day-to-day problems through coding. Ever since I built my first project, I have picked up a couple of new languages and made a few projects to help me with my day-to-day life, such as the Time management app. Currently, I am learning full-stack development through using Javascript and the MERN stack.
